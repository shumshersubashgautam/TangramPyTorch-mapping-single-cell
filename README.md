# TangramPyTorch-mapping-single-cell
Tangram is a Python package, written in PyTorch and based on scanpy, for mapping single-cell (or single-nucleus) gene expression data onto spatial gene expression data. The single-cell dataset and the spatial dataset should be collected from the same anatomical region/tissue type, ideally from a biological replicate, and need to share a set of genes. Tangram aligns the single-cell data in space by fitting gene expression on the shared genes.
